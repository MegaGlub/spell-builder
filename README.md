# Mega Glub's spell-builder

<img src="https://github.com/MegaGlub/spell-builder/blob/main/images/wands/brass-light.gif">

- "spell-builder" is a custom program created with Electron.js for the purposes of conveying a complex custom magic system for a personal ttrpg to players through the use of a convenient and easy to use[^1] GUI.
The main reason for the inception of the project was to avoid having to define such complex behavior through spreadsheets and regular documentation, and as a more direct means of communication.

- The program can be compiled and run via the command `npm run start`, or downloaded from the releases tab.

- If you don't already have access to the specifics of the ttrpg system outside of this program, you're not going to get it.
